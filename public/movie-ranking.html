<h1>The Best Movies According To Marina</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>The Godfather</h3> 
<p>This magnificent multigenerational mafia drama represents a benchmark not just in crime movies but in American cinema as a whole.
<br/>The Godfather works like a masterfully conducted orchestra, whose immaculate symphony is a meticulously crafted and extraordinarily integral thread in the fabric of cinema history.
<br/>Villains and criminals that fulfill the American dream with complete disregard for the American way. A contradiction that engenders gods.</p> 
<h3>Scarface</h3> 

<p>Scarface has become a touchstone of pop culture, one of the half dozen or so most frequently referenced films of our era.
<br/>It is a serious, often hilarious peek under the rock where nightmares strut in $800 suits and Armageddon lies around the next twist of treason.</p>
<h3>Coldmountain</h3>
<p>A rapturous, unusual romantic adventure, detailing mostly unexplored sides to the Civil War and female companionship.
<br/>It does achieve, if only intermittently, the aching feelings of love and loss, for both country and countrymen, that Frazier depicted so unforgettably in his novel.
